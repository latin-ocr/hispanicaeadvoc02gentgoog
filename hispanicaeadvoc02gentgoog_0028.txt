place to another.

CHAPTER V.-Whetber it is lacustri to capture the enemy in tlte
territory of another.

One may pursue a wild beast into a neighbor‘s field or a
fugitive from justice into another’s territory, and one may hold
with the ancients that “war is a hunt,” and with the doctors
that “a territory is nothing else than a domain,” drawing the
conclusion therelrom that a public enemy may be captured
in another’s territory. But this conclusion is ialse. “The
territory oi another insures safety, and, when territory changes,
control changes.” It is commonly held that when a fugitive
flees into a choreb, he is sale. This privilege is opposed to
the public interest and to the theory ol the common law, but
il the doctrine holds in the case ol a church, it is still more
applicable when there is a complete change ol territory. Il it
holds lor a fugitive lrom justice, it should surely hold under
the laws oi war. But what shall we say to the principle ol law
which I have laid down in my books On rte Low ol Wor
that “anybody and everybody is bound to hand over to the
victor the property and the person oi the vanquished?” 1
reply that “this doctrine may be affirmed in the case oi a ·
complete victory, not in the ease ol a small suecess.” “It may
not be lawlul perse lorche victor to take the spoils, and he
who rules a territory may not always be required to turn them
over to the victor.”

CHAPTl-:R VI.-Whether it is lacustri to conduct on enemy captive
through another's territory.

“The Spanish Ambassador opposes the action ol the Dutch
in taking property captured from their Spanish enemies . . .
through the British sea and along these shores, and he asks the
magistrate here that all the property be stopped and be re·
leased.'‘ Various arguments may be urged in opposition to this
request. For instance, it is lawlul to transport grain through
a place from which it is unlawiul to export it.' Some doctore
also hold that il a eriminal is being conducted through the
graveyard oi a church, or even through territory under another
