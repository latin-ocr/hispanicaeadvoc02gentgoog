Defense on the part of the English was justified, because they
feared harm to themselves and to the T urks‚ who were their
traveling companions and whom they had undertaken to
carry. “Wrong is done to us when it is done to another
who is in our horne, for a ship herself is likened to a home.”
If defense was justifiable, even if the Tuscan attaclr was
justified, preference should be given to defense over offense.
Itis true that a partial state of war exists between the English
and the Tuscans‚ but this does not make the goods taken the
property of the Tuscans‚ because they were not owned by
the saiIors, who, in fighting, were not acting under the
instructions of the owners, and under the public laws of war
the sailors may not be regarded as pirates.

CHAPTER XXVIII.-Passaqr·money is owed for the Turks captured
by the Tuscans on an Enqlislr ship.

The passage-money, which the Turks were to have paid

for their transportation in the English ship captured by the
Tuscans,² must be paid by the Tuscans‚ because “the victor

takes the place of the vanquished,'’ and “ claims upon property
go with it when it changes hands.”
