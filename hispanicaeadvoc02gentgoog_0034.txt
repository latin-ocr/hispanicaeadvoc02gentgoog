300 Introduction

The Spaniards ask to be permitted to cross to Belgium,
whither they had set out, under a royal sale conduct. It would
not be real redress to them, and it would not be a penalty to
the Dutch, for the offense which they have committed against

England’s sovereignty, to send these Spaniards back to Spain,
because this disposition of the case is exactly what would ⁷

please the Dutch. It may be urged that the King ol F sance
at one time sent Spaniards, who were on their way to Ireland
as enemies of England, back to Spain. The two cases are
not parallel, however. The Spanish do not seem to have
committed the offense against French sovereignty which the
Dutch have committed against English sovereignty, and being
sent to Spain they would be on the direct route to Ireland.

[The argument in this chapter supplements Chapter ΧΙΙ.]
English merchants claim to have bought the goods in con-
troversy from the fiscus of Barbary, and they claim legal
ownership under a constitution oi Zeno's, which enunciates the
principle that a prince may take the property ol his subjecta.
But the King ol Barbary does not recognize the Justinian Code.
Consequently this constitution would not hold good in Barbary.
Itis not even clear that a formal purchase was made from
the fiscus. The right of the fiscus to sell such property is open
to question, and the bad raith ol the merchants is proved by
their effacement ol the marks of the original owners.

There is no redress to be had from Barbary, and if the
procedure there is recognized as legal, the pirates will have
a convenient place, close to the Spanish lines oi trade, to
dispose of their booty.

England and Spain had made a treaty and under a royal
