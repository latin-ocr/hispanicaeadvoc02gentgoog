Introduction 23⁰

CHAPTER IL—That property does not telonq to the enemy rubo takes
it until it has been brouqht within his fortified lines.

The property mentioned in the last chapter does not pass

into the ownership oi the enemy until it has been brought
within his fortilied lines, no matter how long it may be in his
possession. The fleet oi the Greeks standing oli Troy may have
constituted a lortified line, but a single ship does not, and
there was but one ship in this case. The rule that a capture
is effective only alter the captured property has been brought
within lortified lines is supported by such doctors as Angelus
and Salycetus. In the case before us the Spanish owners have
not even lost possession. They retained it by means oi the
Spanish sailors who were leison board the captured Spanish
vessel. Not only was this property not brought within fortified

lines, but the Spaniards had a fair chance oi escaping.

CHAPTER Ill-On the judqment passed by soldiers and on tbe
varying martire r'n the matter of tbinys captured by the enemy.

It is said to be the practice of soldiers “ to regard captured
property as theirs, ir they have kept it with them ior a night.'’
The phrase, “with them‚” probably means within their tortified
lines, so that this military usage is in harmony with the law
which I have discussed in the last chapter.

CHAPTER IV.-That property sure to be taken is not held as taken
and required by the enemy.

Cephalus holds that “a thing is called captured when it can
not escape capture,” and he applies this dictum to a certain
case ol pirates. Molina applies it to wild beasts which have
been injured by one hunter and ultimately taken by another.
But “to pirates and wild beasts no territory offers safety.”
Now this principle is not true in war, oi our Spaniards, ior
instance, who are saie in neutral territory. Ii a wild boar
falls into a snare which I have set and you let him go iree, he
ceases to be mine. The boar might have been able to free
himself. But whatever the usage in hunting may be, it does
not determine the law oi war. Usage must be established ior
the kind of case under discussion, and we must remember too
