THE CLASSICS OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

This series, which includes the classic works connected with the history and develop-
ment of international law, was undertaken by the Carnegie Institution of Washiugtou
'in 190⁶, at the suggestion of Mr. James Brown Scott, then Solicitor for the Departruent
‘of State, under whose supervision aa General Editor the series iras since been published.
On January 1, 1917, the project was transferred to the Carnegre Endowment or Inter-
uational Peace and the publication of the series is being continued by the Endowment’s
lIgivision of Intemational Low, of which the Genera! Editor of the Classics is tlte

irector.

The republication of these classica has been undertaken principally on account of
the difficulty of procuring the texts in convenient form for scientific study. The text of
each author is reproduced photographically, so as to lay the source before the reader
without the mistalres which creep into a newly printed text. Au introduction is prefixed
to each work, giving the necessary biographical details concerning its author and statIng
the importunes of t e text aud its place in internetione} law. Tables of errata iu the
original are added when necessary, and notes to clear up doubts and ambiguities or to
correct mistakes in the text are supplied. Each of the Classica is specially edited by an
{xpetrss in interssational ml atnctl is lsctcompanied by au English version made exprersly
or eserres acom eeu ransaor.
